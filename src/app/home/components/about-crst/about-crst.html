 is a comprehensive, national digital platform developed to streamline the registration, management, and public disclosure of security interests in both movable and immovable property. iCoMS provides a unified and secure system that enhances transparency, reduces risk, and facilitates access to credit through secured transactions. This platform enables borrowers to use a broader range of assets as collateral, while offering lenders a reliable tool to verify existing security interests in real time. The system also ensures public access to accurate and up-to-date information, thereby fostering trust in the credit market and minimizing the risk of fraud or multiple claims on the same asset.
</p>

<p>
  Incorporating a secure online payment gateway and user-friendly features, iCoMS represents a significant advancement in Bhutan’s financial and legal infrastructure. It supports inclusive economic growth by making secured lending more accessible, particularly for small businesses, rural communities, and individuals seeking to leverage their assets for financial empowerment.

  <h3>Our Institutional Partnership</h3>

  <ul class="institutional-points">
    <li>
      <strong>iCoMS</strong> is a joint initiative of the 
      <strong>Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan (RMA)</strong> and the 
      <strong>National Land Commission Secretariat (NLCS)</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>
      This collaboration integrates two critical national systems into a
      single digital platform:
    </li>

    <ul class="sub-points">
      <li>
        <strong>Central Registry for Secured Transactions (CRST):</strong>
        Records security interests in movable property and is administered
        solely by RMA in accordance with the Executive Order issued by the
        Ministry of Finance on 22 August 2012.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Land Mortgage System (LMS):</strong>
        Jointly managed by RMA and NLCS, where NLCS serves as the lead agency
        responsible for maintaining mortgage records related to immovable
        property, as mandated by Section 181 of the Land Act 2007. RMA provides
        overall system oversight and ensures regulatory compliance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>
      By integrating these systems, iCoMS simplifies collateral registration
      and access, making secured lending faster, more transparent, and more
      reliable for all stakeholders.
